\chapter{Introduction}
The new energy level of LHC allowed experimentalists to perform various searches.
These searches have probbed a broad variety of possible theories that can explain how the universe is working, i.e
from how objects are falling to how quarks compose protons.
One of the most promissing ones was the Standard model (SM) of particle physics. As a result of comprehensive searches at LHC
the discovery of Higgs Boson in 2012 completed the last missing part of the theory.
Up to now, the Standard model (SM) of particle physics has succesfully explained the physics observed in LHC.
However, SM has several shortcomings.
