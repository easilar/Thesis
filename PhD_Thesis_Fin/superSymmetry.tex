\chapter{Supersymmetry: an extension of the Standard Model}
%\label{:Supersymmetry}
%\minitoc


%It has been more than two thousand years, as thinking population of the Earth we wondered about our surroundings. We thought about what are the fundamentals of all matter around us. Our steps, starting from the first atomic theory by Democritus ($\sim 400$ B.C.) later with the better understanding of Quantum theory in the $20^{th}$ century, lead us up to Standard Model of particle physics.

%The Standard Model describes the interactions of particle and the fundamental forces driving those interactions. One of the milestones in this path is the unification of electric and magnetic forces into a single theory of electromagnetism described by Maxwell$\textquotesingle$s equations in the middle of the $19^{th}$ century. 
%The first half of the following century was a rush of particle discoveries and corresponding theories describing their natures. In this journey, the extra ordinary studies of M. Plank, E. Rutherford, A. Einstein, L. de Broglie, W. Pauli, E. Schroedinger, W.  Heisenberg, P. Dirac, E. Fermi, H. Yukawa, C.N. Yang, R. Mills and J. Schwinger were the pillars of the Standard Model, which unifies the three of the four known forces of our universe. These three forces are the electromagnetic, the weak and the strong forces. The missing fourth force is the gravity that failed to enter the SM framework. In addition to this the SM has several other shortcomings. This chapter will commence with a brief introduction of the SM and its experimental status in Section \ref{sec:StandardModel}. Then in Section \ref{sec:susySol}, Supersymmetry as a possible extension to the SM will be shortly explained from theoretical and experimental aspects. 

%Although the standard model has proved its consistency in many tests done by colliders, there are many experimental% evidence that drive us to look beyond it. For example, one of the reasons to search for new physics is that the SM is not providing a dark matter candidate. Being one of the most promising extensions of the SM, the supersymmetry handle this shortcoming by having a neutral heavy particle, \ninoone , as a sufficient dark matter candidate.  
%In this chapter, mainly concentrating on the supersymmetry, a brief explanation of the SM and its possible extensions will be represented. Moreover, the experimental status of these theories will be also discussed later in the chapter.

This chapter commences with a discussion of the \acrshort{sm} of particle physics. After presenting a brief theoretical overview, its success in explaining the majority of the experimental results will be discussed. We will then ponder on the missing aspects of the SM as a complete theory. The second part of this chapter is dedicated to the supersymmetric models, as one of the possible theories \acrfull{bsm}. The \acrfull{susy} discussion will include the framework of \acrfull{sms}: The results presented in this thesis are interpreted with in \acrshort{sms}.\\
The details of this chapter can be found in various textbooks and reviews on the SM, quantum field theory~\cite{SM1,SM2,SM3,nickef,srednicki} and SUSY~\cite{SUSY1}.
\section{Standard Model}
\label{sec:StandardModel}
\subsection{Particle content}
\label{sec:StandardModelParticleContent}

%According to the SM the universe is composed of 3 families, which are very similar to each other. The first family is the substance we see around us. The second and third families are heavier than the first family. 
%The SM is an $SU(3)_C \otimes SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y$ gauge theory. 

The \acrshort{sm} describes fundamental particles and their interactions. In this respect, the \acrshort{sm} attempts to explain all physical phenomena with the exception of gravity, which has an insignificant effect on subatomic particles. There are three known fundamental interactions or forces in the \acrshort{sm}: the electromagnetic, the weak and the strong force. The interactions are mediated by force carrier particles called bosons. Bosons are quanta of gauge fields describing aforementioned interactions. The electromagnetic interactions are carried by the photon while Z and W bosons are responsible for the weak interactions. In the \acrshort{sm} framework, these two seemingly different forces can be unified through the so-called \acrfull{ewk}. For the strong interactions, the force carrier bosons are called gluons and they are massless. Bosons are integer spin particles obeying the Bose-Einstein statistics.
The elementary particles that constitute the all known forms of matter are called fermions.
Obeying the Fermi-Dirac statistics, fermions are particles with half spin.  Fermions incorporate quarks (with color charge) and leptons (without color charge). According to the \acrshort{sm}, fermions can be categorized as three families or generations, which are very similar to each other in terms of characteristics of the particles. The first family represents the substance we see around us, the rest can be observed in the colliders or nuclear reactors or in the atmospheric showers.   
Fig. \ref{fig:SM_particles} shows the particle content  of the SM\footnote{ In this thesis, the matter and anti-matter particles are not distinguished.}. All are experimentally confirmed.

  \label{fig:SM_particles}
\end{figure*}
The range of these forces is inversely proportional to their masses. The photon is massless so the range of electromagnetism is infinite while the range of weak force is constrained by the large mass of the corresponding gauge bosons. This mechanism is more complicated in the case of the strong force; it will be discussed in the next paragraphs.

\subsection{Particle interactions}
\label{sec:StandardModelParticleInteractions}

The theory that aims to model strong force is called \acrfull{qcd}. In Greek, the word $\chi\rho\hat{\omega}\mu\alpha$ chroma means color.\\
After observation of bound states such as $\Delta^{++}_{(uuu)}$ \cite{Dbaryons1,Dbaryons2}, violating Pauli\textquoteright s exclusion principle, it is suggested that the quarks possess three color (red , blue, green) charges \cite{GMann, GMann1}. The interaction between quarks occurs through gluons. The fact that gluons have color charge make them interact with themselves as well. Accordingly, \acrshort{qcd} also admits bound states whose valence constituents are all gluons, the non-abelian gauge bosons of \acrshort{qcd}. These additional mesons are one of the most important predictions of the \acrshort{sm} and they are known as gluonia or glueballs. However, so far they have not been observed experimentally. For further reading, ~\cite{glueball1, glueball2} can be consulted.\\
\acrshort{qcd} has two important postulates.
%an additional SU(3) gauge degree of freedom, 

Confinement:
In nature, we observe only color singlet (colorless) particles. The particles with color charges, i.e. quarks and gluons, immediately coalesce to form colorless bound states (hadrons) given an attempt to separate them. This is also known as hadronization. As a result of this phenomenon, despite the fact that gluons are massless, the range of the strong force is confined. Moreover, in experiments a shower of color-neutral particles, which is called as jet and will be explained in Sec.\ref{sec:PFJET}, is observed instead of a single quark.

Asymptotic freedom:
The interaction of quarks becomes asymptotically weaker as the energy increases or as the distance decreases. In other words, the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$  increases with distance, but inside a meson or a baryon, they act as free particles. This asymptotic freedom helps to build a perturbative description of \acrshort{qcd} interactions; otherwise \acrshort{qcd} calculations are extremely complicated.\\
%%%%
The interaction of charged particles with energies of the order of the W boson mass can be described  by \acrfull{qed}. The symmetry group of the electromagnetic theory is a unitary transformation $U(1)_{EM}$ and there is a massless field associated to the photon.
The $\beta$-decay, where the neutron decays to a proton, electron and corresponding antineutrino through the $W$ boson was explained by Enrico Fermi by an effective theory~\cite{Fermi}. The theory is based on an $SU(2)_L$ symmetry group. The subscript “L” stands for the left handed particles. Due to lack of right handed neutrinos in nature, only left handed fermions contribute to the \textbf{weak interaction}.
In 1960s, Glashow-Salam-Weinberg proposed a unified theory of the QED and weak interactions ~\cite{glashow,salam,weinberg}.
After unification of the electric and the magnetic interactions by Maxwell, the unification of electromagnetic and weak interactions is an encouraging step towards \acrfull{gut} that attempt to unify all interactions into a single theory.
However, in the formulation of the \acrshort{gut}, initially all the mass of particles are 0, in contrast to experiment.
Brout, Englert~\cite{higgs1} and Higgs~\cite{higgs2} solved the problem by implementing \acrfull{ewsb}, called BEH mechanism or only the Higgs mechanism. It introduces an additional scalar field, the Higgs field. The \acrshort{sm} Higgs boson is a Goldstone boson with mass given by $m_H=\sqrt{2\lambda}\nu$ \footnote{\label{fn:vev}$\nu=(\sqrt{2}G_F)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\approx$246GeV, $G_F$ is Fermi Coupling}. The massive bosons of the weak interaction gain their mass through a non-zero \acrfull{vev} while for fermions direct Yukawa couplings to the Higgs boson provide the mass term.
Particles interact with the Higgs field at a different strength. Depending on the coupling between the Higgs field and the particle, its mass can be large or small. The Photons, having zero rest mass, do not couple to Higgs field. In the absence of the Higgs field, all the particles would be massless. 

%The SM particle content and their interactions were briefly covered in this section. 
%The chapter will continue with formulation of the SM.

\subsection{Experimental results}
\label{sec:StandardModelExp}

The entire \acrshort{sm} particle content was discovered up to now. The fermionic substance was completed with the discovery of the top quark by the CDF and D$\O$ experiments in 1995~\cite{top1,top2}. In 2012, a particle, with a mass of approximately 125 GeV, which has similar features to the Higgs boson predicted by \acrshort{sm} was discovered by \acrshort{atlas} and \acrshort{cms} experiments~\cite{higgsexp1,higgsexp2,higgsexp3}. Further studies with a much larger data set have provided precise measurements of its mass, production properties and decay rates. Results are consistent with the \acrshort{sm} within uncertainties. With this new discovery, the bosonic content of the \acrshort{sm} is also completed.\\
Testing the \acrshort{sm} is not limited to collider experiments. In fact, due to the technological constraints, probing the energies much larger than TeV scale is not possible with collider experiments and higher energies must be studied in e.g. astrophysical observations. In addition to cosmological and collider experiments, there are smaller scale table-top experiments where particle properties can be further investigated with high precision at low energies ($\leq$ GeV).
In Fig.~\ref{tab:SM_tests}, an overview of the different types of experiments probing the \acrshort{sm} can be seen. In addition to this, an example list of different kinds of measurements is also added to the table, including benchmark experiments. The colors coarsely indicate the degree of the consistency of the measurements with the \acrshort{sm}. Green indicates that the experimental results are consistent with \acrshort{sm}, yellow is showing that the measurements point out a deviation from \acrshort{sm} predictions, and red evince that there must be a theory beyond the \acrshort{sm}. The apparent shortcomings are the topic of the next section.

\subsection{Shortcomings}
\label{sec:shortcomingsOfSM}
As mentioned in the previous section, no evidence of new physics beyond the SM has been found at the LHC. Moreover, up to now, the SM has successfully explained the world of subatomic physics. However, there are reasons hinting at the incompleteness of the SM.
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item \textbf{Experimental reasons}
%\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Experimental reasons}
\textbf{Lacking explanation of gravity:} Certainly, the observation of gravitational waves is one of the two most exciting discoveries of our decade. The announcement was done by LIGO and Virgo collaborations on 11 Feb 2016~\cite{LigoVirgo}. The observed waveform satisfies the predictions of general relativity~\cite{GR}.
However, unless the gravitational field is quantized, it is impossible for the SM to include gravity.\\
\textbf{No Dark Matter candidate:} In 1933, Fritz Zwicky observed a discrepancy between the observed gravitating mass distribution in a galaxy and the velocity distribution of stars by applying the Virial theorem, which relates the gravitational potential energy of a system to its kinetic energy, to the Coma cluster. He introduced this unseen mass as \acrfull{dm}, originally in German called \textit{dunkle Materie}~\cite{DM1}. The evidence for \acrshort{dm} became stronger with the observations made by V. Rubin and K. Ford on the velocity distribution of more than twenty spiral galaxies~\cite{DM2}. Moreover, the observations of anisotropies in the \acrfull{cmb} further supported the existence of \acrshort{dm}. The data provided by Planck experiment, successor of COBE~\cite{DM4} and WMAP~\cite{DM3} experiments, is in good agreement with the $\Lambda$CDM (Lambda cold dark matter) model~\cite{DM5}. This model postulates a dark energy dominated (68\%) flat universe, with 5\% baryonic matter and 27\% dark matter. Therefore, given the SM does not provide a viable cold dark matter candidate\footnote{In this context, Neutrinos are hot (relativistic) particles}, in fact the SM fails to explain 95\% of content of our universe.\\
\textbf{Neutrino masses:} The observation of neutrino oscillations~\cite{Nu1,Nu2} implies that at least two of the neutrinos should have non zero mass\footnote{The oscillation frequencies are proportional to the mass difference of the neutrino flavors. Therefore, only upper bounds can be measured.}. Neutrino masses can be included in the \acrshort{sm} by means of a Yukawa coupling term. However, it is difficult to explain their smallness. The various theoretical models that alleviate this apparent hierarchy, go beyond the \acrshort{sm}. 

%\newpage
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item \textbf{Theoretical reasons}
%\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Theoretical reasons}
In addition to the observations described above, the \acrshort{sm} has also theoretical shortcomings.
\textbf{Grand Unification:}
The unification of forces has started with the integration of electric and magnetic forces into one electromagnetic force. Then it was followed by the unification of electromagnetic and weak forces into the electroweak interaction. At this point, it is inevitable that one expects the merge of electroweak and strong interactions. In fact, the running couplings of electroweak and strong forces, as seen in the Fig.~\ref{fig:GUT}, meet at around 10$^{16}$ GeV.
The renormalization group evolution of the \acrshort{sm} couplings does not unify and hence it's not possible to embed the group structure, which is described in the previous sections, in a single gauge group.\\

  }
  \label{fig:GUT}
\end{figure*}
\textbf{Hierarchy problem:}
In the literature of particle physics, there are two kinds of hierarchy problems; the big and the little hierarchy problem. The first one is due to the huge difference between mass scale of weak forces ($m_W$) and gravity (Planck scale\footnote{The Planck scale is the scale at which classical gravity theory is no longer valid but quantum gravity dominates. $M_P=2.4$x$10^{18}$GeV}).
In fact, this is not a consistency problem but a naturalness problem. The latter, the little hierarchy problem, is a problem of how large $m_{H}^2$, in Eq.\ref{higgspot}, can get. The Higgs boson with a mass around 125 GeV implies that $\lambda=0.126$ and $m^2=-(92.9\,{\rm GeV})^2$. 
Loop corrections from heavy fermions to the Higgs boson mass suggest that the natural value for $m_H$ is at the GUT scale and not at the EWK scale.
%The problem is that $m^2$ receives enormous quantum corrections because Higgs boson, including itself, couples to all massive particles in the \acrshort{sm}. 
This subject will be discussed carefully in the upcoming sections.\\
There are many theories \acrfull{bsm} claiming to solve some of the aforementioned \acrshort{sm} shortcomings. The candidate \acrshort{bsm} theory is expected not to belie the current observations; on the contrary it should predict them. Moreover, in order to be able to test the theory, it should also provide a phenomenological background. 
In the variety of \acrshort{bsm} theories which satisfies these constraints, the Supersymmetric extensions to the \acrshort{sm} can be considered as the most promising ones.
This thesis focuses on a specific subset of supersymmetric models which will be discussed in the following section.

\section{Supersymmetry as a solution}
\label{sec:susySol}
The Coleman-Mandula theorem~\cite{CMT} restricts the symmetry group of a wide class of local quantum field theories, including most extensions of the \acrshort{sm}, to a direct product of the Poincar\'{e} group and an internal symmetry group. It was later found that anti-commutators can eschew this limitation by extending the Poincar\'{e} to the Superpoincare group~\cite{Psusy2}. The new symmetry relates fermionic states to bosonic states.
%, had already attracted physicists' attention in the first half of the twentieth century. 
 This theoretical concept is known as \acrshort{susy}. The supersymmetric transformations change the spin of the original \acrshort{sm} fields by $\frac{1}{2}$ and thus turns fermionic states into bosonic states, and vice versa. The new fields are called superpartners. If these superpartners exist in TeV scale they can help overcome several problems mentioned in Sec.\ref{sec:shortcomingsOfSM}. \\
The existence of \acrshort{susy} may lead to spectacular results that can be listed as follows:\\
\\
\textbf{Solving the hierarchy problem:}
\\
As mentioned in the previous section, the Higgs boson couples to each massive SM fermion $f$ through a Yukawa coupling  $\lambda_f$. Therefore, the Higgs boson bare mass, the $m^2$ term in Eq.~\ref{higgspot}, receives large quantum corrections. The one-loop radiative correction terms (see Fig.~\ref{fig:higgsloop} left) from a Dirac fermion $f$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{deltaH1}
{\Delta m_H^2 = - \frac{|\lambda_f|^2}{8\pi^2}\Lambda_{UV}^2+...}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Lambda_{UV}$ is an ultraviolet momentum cutoff, which is used to restrict the loop integral. The cutoff can be interpreted as the energy scale at which the \acrshort{sm} breaks down. 
Because the top quark is the one with the largest mass among the SM fermions\footnote{Eq.~\ref{deltaH1} should be multiplied by 3 to account for colors.} ($\lambda_f \approx 0.94$), it gives the largest contribution to $m_H^2$. If $\Lambda_{UV}$ is of the order the Planck mass, then this correction to $m_H^2$ is around 30 orders of magnitude larger than the required value of $m_H^2$ for the Higgs boson with a mass around 125 GeV.
In addition to the correction term given in Eq.~\ref{deltaH1}, a similar correction is predicted for a massive scalar particle $S$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:higgsloop} right) as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{deltaH2}
{\Delta m_H^2 =  \frac{\lambda_S}{16\pi^2}\Lambda_{UV}^2+...}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\lambda_S$ is the coupling strength between the scalar particle and the Higgs field. 
It should be noted that this time correction carries an opposite sign. In this way, the diverging terms can be eliminated if a scalar particle exist and couplings conspire such that $\lambda_S = \frac{1}{2}|\lambda_f|^2$.\\
SUSY overcomes the hierarchy problem by imposing superpartners, which possess the same quantum numbers with original fields except for the spin.
%As long as the masses of the superpartners are of the order O(TeV), SUSY can still be considered as natural. 
In order to achieve  this, the \acrshort{susy} breaking needs to be soft. This means that it remains a valid symmetry of the underlying laws of physics but is broken in the course of the evolution of the state of the universe. The discussion will be further expanded in Sec.\ref{sec:Albsusy}.
\\
\\
\textbf{Dark matter candidate:}
\\
The lower limit on the proton lifetime is set to $10^{33}$ years by experiments carried out in the water Cherenkov detector at Super Kamiokande in Japan~\cite{protonLifetime}. This fact strongly suggests that the baryon number is conserved.  Unlike the SM, in \acrshort{susy} theories the baryon and lepton number conservation can be violated. In \acrshort{susy}, to prevent proton decay, a new quantum number, called as {\it R}-parity is introduced: 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{Rparity}
{R =  (-1)^{3B+L+2S}}\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where $B$ represents the baryon number, $L$ is the lepton number, and $S$ denotes the spin.
All the \acrshort{sm} particles have positive {\it R}-parity, while the superpartners have negative {\it R}-parity. Conservation of {\it R}-party~\cite{RparityConv} entails that the \acrshort{susy} particles can only be produced in pairs. Moreover, in SUSY, this conservation leads to a stable the \acrfull{lsp}~\cite{LSP1,LSP2}.
In many models, the \acrshort{lsp} is electrically neutral and has no color charge. Therefore, it interacts at most weakly.
% is neutral in terms of both electric and color charge.
Depending on the model parameters, SUSY theories predict a wide range of LSP masses.
%In \acrshort{susy}, the mass of the \acrshort{lsp} is not theoretically predictable. 
Constraints on the LSP mass come from come from Cosmological observation of the \acrshort{dm} relic density. In particular we see that, assuming a standard thermal evolution of the universe, the correct observed relic density \cite{DM5} is achievable if the new physics lies around the EW scale. This represents a good motivation to look for SUSY at the LHC, where the \acrshort{lsp} can be directly produced, or result from the decays of heavier sparticles.
%Thus it is one of the most viable cold dark matter candidates and it has great importance in this thesis.
%If it exists, it would appear as a high missing energy in the events observed by experiments.
So-called {\it R}-parity violating SUSY theories do not respect this symmetry and therefore do not typically predict a pair of LSPs in the final state. While dedicated collider searches exist, these models are beyond the scope of this work.
%There are also R-party violating \acrshort{susy} theories, but these are beyond the scope of this work. 
\\
\\
\textbf{Unification of gauge couplings:}
\\
Precise measurements of the running weak, strong and electromagnetic couplings performed at the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP) indicates that these couplings fail to unify at high energy (see Fig.~\ref{fig:GUT} a)~\cite{ALEPH,GUTLep}. In Ref.~\cite{GUTLep}, for unification of gauge coupling constants (see Fig.~\ref{fig:GUT} b), it is shown that the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) is the only possibility, without an intermediate mass scale. The MSSM can raise the scale of the unification by introducing a particle called the gluino, the spin half partner of the gluon. The gluino partially cancels the asymptotic freedom effect of the gluon itself~\cite{Wil}. 
The MSSM and its particle content will be explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:mssmPartContect}.
%\textbf{Including gravity:}
%Even if it is not the subject of this thesis, it is worth mentioning that there is a SUSY model including gravity, namely supergravity. This model introduces a spin-2 massless gauge field, the graviton, which mediates gravity with its superpartner, the gravitino.  Supergravity, like any other QFT of gravity, is also not renormalizable.
\subsection{Algebra of Supersymmetry}
\label{sec:Albsusy}
As it is stated in the beginning of this chapter, a SUSY transformation turns a bosonic state into a fermionic state, and vice versa. SM particles and their superpartners constitute supermultiplets. For each of the chiral\footnote{left or right eigenstate of the chirality projector} SM fermions, there is a separate scalar partner and together they form chiral supermultiplets. The supersymmetric transformation operator $Q$ can also be called as supercharge operator, can be read as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{Q}
Q\ket{fermion} = \ket{boson} \nonumber\\
Q\ket{boson} = \ket{fermion}.
\end{eqnarray}
In SUSY, the number of supercharges characterizes the theory. If there is only one supercharge then it is called a N=1 supersymmetry.  If there are two supercharges then there is a N=2 supersymmetry and so on. 
For chiral fermions, the generators $Q$ and $Q^{\dagger}$ satisfy the commutation and anti-commutation relations:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{Qrelations}
{\{Q,Q^{\dagger}\}=P^{\mu} \, , \, \{Q,Q\}=\{Q^{\dagger},Q^{\dagger}\}=0 \,,\, [P^{\mu},Q]=[P^{\mu},Q^{\dagger}]=0}
\end{eqnarray}
where $P^{\mu}=(H,\overrightarrow{p})$ stands for the spacetime momentum operator in which $H$ is the Hamiltonian and $\overrightarrow{p}$ is the three-momentum operator. 
Similar to chiral supermultiplets, the SM gauge bosons together with their fermionic supersymmetric partners form gauge supermultiplets.
The algebra in Eq.~\ref{Qrelations} implies that the partner and the superpartner states have the same mass. However, no scalar superpartners have been found yet, although, e.g. the selectron with mass $m_e$ would be easy to detect. This indicates that the supersymmetry is broken and the superpartners have much larger mass.
%\newpage
\subsection{Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model}
\label{sec:mssmPartContect}
The \acrshort{mssm} is the supersymmetric extension of the SM with the minimal particle content.
%minimal irreducible representation of the SUSY algebra (the aforementioned N=1 supersymmetry case).
In other words, this is the model with the least number of additional particles and degrees of freedom. 
%All other representations can be reduced to combinations of chiral and gauge supermultiplets.
The \acrshort{mssm} chiral supermultiplets are shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:mssmChiral} while the gauge multiplets are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:mssmGauge}. 
As in the table, all superpartners are represented by a version containing a tilde ($^ {\sim} $) of the original SM particle symbols. The scalar counterparts, are indicated by adding an ``s'' as initials to the SM fermion names  (e.g. selectron) while the fermionic gauge superpartners are represented by appending ``ino'' (e.g gluino). The subscripts $L$ and $R$ of the sleptons show only the helicity of their SM partners.

\caption{Gauge supermultiplets of the MSSM}\label{tab:mssmGauge}
\end{table}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1}
In \acrshort{mssm}, there are two Higgs chiral supermultiplets. They are the cure of the gauge anomaly, in other words, they leave the action invariant under the supersymmetry transformation. Moreover, by the construction of \acrshort{susy}, the Higgs doublet with hypercharge $Y=\frac{1}{2}$ is only able to give masses to the up-type quarks while the one with hypercharge $Y=-\frac{1}{2}$ gives masses to the down-type quarks and charged fermions. Therefore, the $SU(2)_L$ complex scalar fields with hypercharge $Y=\frac{1}{2}$ and~$Y=-\frac{1}{2}$ can be denoted by $H_u$ and~$H_d$ respectively. The half spin superpartners are called higgsinos and represented as $\tilde{H}_u$ and~$\tilde{H}_d$.\\
The gluino is the half-integer spin color octet supersymmetric partner of the gluon. The superpartners of the electroweak gauge bosons are called winos and binos.\\
\acrshort{ewsb} in the \acrshort{susy} sector leaves the gauge quantum numbers intact and therefore the higgsinos and electroweak gauginos mix with each other. The mixing of $\tilde{W}^0$ and $\tilde{B}^0$ are called zino ($\tilde{Z}^0$) and photino($\tilde{\gamma}$). The mixing between neutral higgsinos and the neutral gauginos results in four mass eigenstates called neutralinos and denoted by \ninoi ($i = 1, 2, 3, 4$). Similarly, the charged higgsinos and winos combine to form two mass eigenstates called charginos denoted by \chipmi ($i = 1, 2$).\\
The soft breaking of the MSSM is introduced by adding a term ($L^{MSSM}_{soft}$) to the Lagrangian. %As mentioned when discussing the hierarchy problem, the breaking of \acrshort{susy} needs to be soft. In the \acrshort{mssm}, SUSY breaking is introduced by including a new component ($L^{MSSM}_{soft}$) to the Lagrangian. 
The Lagrangian, then, can be written as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{Lsusy}
{L = L^{MSSM}+L^{MSSM}_{soft}},
\end{eqnarray}
where the Yukawa and gauge interactions are contained in the first term. The soft terms are chosen such that no new ultraviolet divergencies are introduced to scalar masses~\cite{susy_fromRobert}.
%In order not to cause ultraviolet divergences, $L^{MSSM}_{soft}$ includes only the terms with positive mass dimension.
In this way, the correction terms of the Higgs mass contain only logarithmic divergences:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{deltaH3}
{\Delta m_H^2 = -m^2_{soft}[ \frac{\lambda}{16\pi^2}{\rm ln} (\Lambda_{UV}/m_{soft})+...]}\, .
\end{eqnarray}
In order to satisfy the naturalness requirement, $| \Delta m_H^2| < m_H^2|_{measured}$, $m_{soft}$ needs to be of the order of TeV scale. This indicates that the new particles introduced by MSSM, if they exist, should be reachable at the LHC. \\
The $L^{MSSM}_{soft}$ adds 105 new parameters to the 19 SM parameters. These 105 additional parameters are categorized as follows: 48 CP-violating phases in the gaugino/higgsino and squark/slepton sectors, 21 squark/slepton masses, and 36 mixing angles, which modify the mixing of the gauge eigenstates into the mass eigenstates.\\
The large number of parameters of the MSSM make the interpretation of the experimental results challenging. Therefore, using universality assumptions at the \acrshort{gut} scale, the number of free parameters is reduced to five. This model, appropriately, is called the \acrfull{cmssm} and a wide range of its low-mass parameter configurations are exclude by the Higgs mass measurement~\cite{ellis}. 
\subsubsection{Particle decays}
\label{mssm_particleDecays}
To stay in the scope of this work, only the {\it R}-parity conserving scenarios are discussed. In these models, the cascade decays of SUSY particles always end with an \acrshort{lsp}. In this search, the lightest neutralino, $ \ninoone$, is the \acrshort{lsp}. For more details see Ch. 9 of~\cite{SUSY1}.
\\
\textbf{Neutralino and chargino} are the mass eigenstates of the higgsinos and gauginos which are the spin half partners of the Higgs and gauge bosons. A neutralino or chargino can decay into lepton+slepton or quark+squark pairs, given the condition that slepton and squark are light enough. A neutralino or chargino may also decay into a Higgs scalar or an electroweak gauge boson via lighter neutralino or chargino. 
Therefore, the possible two-body decay modes for neutralinos and charginos in the MSSM are:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{ChiDecays}
\ninoi \rightarrow Z \ninoj, \, W \chipmj,\,  h^0\ninoj ,\,l\tilde{l},\,\nu\tilde{\nu} \, ,\nonumber\\
\chipmi \rightarrow W \ninoj,\, Z \chipm ,\, h^0\chipm,\,l\tilde{\nu},\,\nu\tilde{l} \, .
\end{eqnarray}
\textbf{Gluino} decays via a squark exclusively, which can be either on- or off-shell. If the on-shell decays are allowed, then $\tilde{g} \rightarrow t\tilde{t}$ and $\tilde{g} \rightarrow b\tilde{b}$ are the dominating channels if $m_{\tilde{t}}$ and $m_{\tilde{b}}$ are the smallest squark masses. Otherwise the squarks are off-shell and this favors the following decays: $\tilde{g} \rightarrow qq\ninoi$ and $\tilde{g} \rightarrow qq'\chipmi$.

\subsection{Simplified Models}
\label{sec:simplifiedModels}
%Another approach would be to focus on a limited set of SUSY particle production and decay modes and allow other parameters to change freely. This effective theory approach is called SMS~\cite{SMS, sms1, sms2} and in this thesis, results are interpreted in the context of SMS. Before introducing the simplified models (see Sec. \ref{sec:simplifiedModels}), 
The \acrshort{sms}~\cite{SMS} involves only a part of the parameter space of MSSM.  This simplification leaves a few phenomenologically relevant parameters to understand the SUSY models; the cross section, branching ratios, and masses.  In this simplified framework, a limited number of decay channels are considered. The branching ratios are often assumed to be 100\% or, alternatively, combinations of such models is used for mixed decays. In this way, results can also be reinterpreted within other (non-)SUSY theories.\\
In a pair production process, primary particles can decay directly or undergo a cascade decay through an intermediate new particle. In each of the models, particle decay chain ends with a neutral, undetected particle, LSP. In the direct decay case, the parameters include the mass of the primary particle and the LSP. When a decay includes an intermediate particle state, the mass of the intermediate particle is also included in the parameters. To reduce the three-dimensional mass space, intermediate particle mass ($m_{\rm int}$) is considered to be dependent to primary particle ($m_{\rm primary}$) and LSP masses ($m_{\rm LSP}$). The relation is given by: $m_{\rm int} = m_{\rm LSP} + x\cdot(m_{\rm primary} - m_{\rm LSP})$. The kinematics of the decay strongly depend on the value of x.\\
A variety of \acrshort{sms} approaches has been investigated by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the LHC.\\
An example for direct decay can be a model of gluino pair production, where each gluino decays to top quark pair and a neutralino. This model is called T1tttt\footnote{this naming is used within the CMS collaboration}. An example for a cascade decay can be a model of gluino pair production, where each gluino decays to two light quarks and an intermediate chargino, with the latter decaying to a gauge boson and a neutralino. When the gauge boson is a W boson, the model is called T5qqqqWW. The diagrams for T1tttt and T5qqqqWW can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:diagrams} left and right respectively. In this thesis, the T5qqqqWW model, with the parameter x=0.5, is used to interpret the results which is well motivated in the searches at LHC~\cite{t51,Psms4}.\\   
%where each of the gluino can undergo a direct decay ($\tilde{g} \rightarrow q\bar{q}\ninoone$) or a cascade decay through an intermediate chargino ($\tilde{g} \rightarrow q\bar{q}\chipmone \rightarrow q\bar{q}(W^{\pm} \ninoone)$).\\
%in the simplified model defined by the decay $\tilde{g} \rightarrow q\bar{q}\ninoone$, gluino decays to two light quarks and a neutralino. The neutralino is considered to be the stable lightest supersymmetric particle or \acrshort{lsp}.
%In a gluino pair production, when each gluino decays in this way, the model is called T1 

%The parameters include the mass of the gluino and the neutralino ($m_{\tilde{g}}$, $m_{\ninoone}$) and the production cross section of the gluino $\sigma(pp\rightarrow \tilde{g}\tilde{g}+X$).
%Taking one step further, we can consider an intermediate chargino state in a decay chain where gluino decays to two light quarks and an intermediate chargino, with the latter decaying to a gauge boson and a neutralino can be read as:
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\label{2step}
%\tilde{g} \rightarrow q\bar{q}\chipmone %\rightarrow q\bar{q}(W^{\pm} \ninoone),\nonumber %\\
%\tilde{g} \rightarrow q\bar{q}\ninotwo %\rightarrow q\bar{q}(Z^0 \ninoone) .
%\end{eqnarray}
%In this case, the mass of the intermediate particle (chargino $\chipmone$ or a heavier neutralino $\ninotwo$) is also included in the parameters. In order to reduce the three-dimensional mass space, chargino mass is considered to be dependent to gluino and neutralino masses. The relation is given by: $m_{\chipmone} = m{\ninoone} + x(m_{\tilde{g}} - m_{\ninoone})$. The kinematics of the decay strongly depend on the value of x.\\
%Turning to gluino pair production, the case where each gluino decays as shown in the chain~\ref{2step}, which indicates the mass of the chargino is at the arithmetic average of the gluino and \acrshort{lsp} masses, is called T5qqqqWW while the direct decay of gluino to top quark pair and  a neutralino is called as T1tttt\footnote{this naming is used within the CMS collaboration}. The diagrams for T1tttt and T5qqqqWW can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:diagrams} left and right respectively. In this thesis, the T5qqqqWW model is used to interpret the results which is well motivated in the searches at LHC \cite{t51,t52}. \\

\subsection{Short History of SUSY searches at colliders}
\label{sec:histSus}
%As an experimentalist to be able to decide where to look for new physics, it is essential to know what has been covered in the past. 
Before the LHC, the first constraints on SUSY had already been set by UA1 experiment and the UA2 experiment at Super Proton Synchrotron. It was until 2000, SUSY searches continued up to 209 GeV at the electron-positron collider LEP~\cite{pdg_old}. Until 2011, The CDF and D$\O$ experiments at the Tevatron extended the limits in the context of cMSSM. In parallel between 1992 and 2007, the H1 and ZEUS experiments at HERA (The electron-proton collider) searched for the R-parity violating production of single SUSY particles. The LHC has started proton-proton collision at a center of mass energy of 7 TeV in 2010. Since then, ATLAS and CMS experiments have performed robust searches and provided strong limits in the context of SMS. The 2011 and 2012 runs of the LHC are called Run~1. During Run~1, 20~fb$^{-1}$ data was collected at a center of mass energy 7 and 8~TeV. In 2012, with the discovery of Higgs boson, the SUSY models have been constrained further. The Higgs mass measurement at around 125~GeV excludes a large range of low-mass \acrshort{cmssm} parameters~\cite{ellis,ellis2}. Later, in the first stage of Run~2, approximately 36~fb$^{-1}$ data has been collected at a center of mass energy 13~TeV. A summary of the both Run~1 and Run~2 results by ATLAS and CMS experiments is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:susy_Summary} including the results from the present search. These results have already pushed the sparticle masses to values where sizable fine-tuning is present in the \acrshort{mssm}. For instance, it was foreseen that the gluinos cannot be much heavier than 1~TeV and the higgsino mass should be around 200~GeV.  Obviously, the latest results challenge these requirements~\cite{corneringSUSY}.  Nevertheless, there is still room for expanding the searches, for example, in the regions with compressed spectra detector acceptance reduces sensitivity.

\textbf{Expectations for gluino searches at 13 TeV:}
\\
Gluino pairs can be produced in LHC, like any other hadron collider, by gluon fusion and quark-anti-quark annihilation (see Fig.~\ref{fig:gluProd}). As it can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:glu_xsec} (left), the cross sections of gluino pair  production are exponentially increased with the center of mass energy. The black line in the figure corresponds to $m_{\tilde{g}}=1.5$~TeV, and the production cross section increases from 0.4~fb~(8 TeV) to 14~fb~(13 TeV).
On the other hand, the expected cross sections of SM processes such as the production of b-quarks, $W^{\pm}$and $Z$-bosons, jets for proton-proton scattering at LHC is large (see Fig.~\ref{fig:sm_xsec}). Given that the total cross section of SM processes is around $10^8$~nb, while the gluino production cross section is 14~fb, 1 event including gluino pair production is expected for $10^{13}$ SM events.
%However, naturally, at the same time the cross section of SM processes increases as well (see Figure \ref{fig:sm_xsec}).
%LHC is a proton-proton collider. Consequently, high sensitivity is favored in the production of color charged particles: the gluino and squarks.\\
%The gluino pair production diagrams are shown in Figure \ref{fig:gluProd}. The cross sections as a function of the center of mass energy and gluino mass are shown respectively in Figure  \ref{fig:glu_xsec} left and right. The cross section of gluino pair production increased significantly from 8 TeV to 13 TeV. However, the cross section of SM processes increased as well (see Figure \ref{fig:sm_xsec}). These figures indicate that at 13 TeV for 10$^{10}$ SM events, 1 event including gluino pair production is expected. This sounds even harder than looking for a 4-leaf clover. 
Nevertheless, it is still feasible to design a robust analysis strategy. An example of such a search will be presented in this thesis and in Sec.~\ref{sec:Comparison} a comparison of the latest results from gluino searches can be found.\\
%\newpage
\textbf{Earlier results of the present analysis:}
\\
As mentioned in the previous section, in the present thesis, a search for SUSY is performed in the context of the simplified model T5qqqqWW. The analysis journey started in Run~1 with a search for a similar model, which was T1tttt. In this model, the presence of two top-antitop quark pairs requires a search for multiple b-tagged (see Sec.~\ref{sec:btagging} for the performance of tagging) quarks in the final state. No significant deviation from the predicted SM background is observed. The related Run 1 results from CMS can be found in Ref.~\cite{SUSRun1}  \\
In Run 2, to increase the discovery potential of the analysis, the channels, which are sensitive to zero b (tagged) final states, are included. These sensitive processes are called T5qqqqWW models. The results had already been presented in the \textit{Moriond 2016} conference in 2016~\cite{SUS_16_005}, with 2.3~fb$^{-1}$ integrated luminosity. Unfortunately, again no significant deviation from the predicted SM background is observed in both of the channels.\\
In Fig.~\ref{fig:Moriond}, the exclusion of the masses, for $m_{\tilde{g}}$ and $m_{\ninoone}$ is shown for the model T1tttt (left) and T5qqqqWW (right).
